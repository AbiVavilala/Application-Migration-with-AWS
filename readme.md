## Introduction

This document outlines the steps and best practices for migrating your application to AWS. AWS provides a range of services and tools that can help you seamlessly migrate your application to the cloud. By following this guide, you will ensure a smooth transition while taking advantage of AWS's scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the migration process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A clear understanding of your application's architecture and dependencies.
- An AWS account with the necessary permissions for resource creation.
- Familiarity with AWS services relevant to your migration (e.g., EC2, RDS, VPC, S3, etc.).
- Backup of your application data and configurations.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Assessment and Plannin

- Current Environment consist of a three tier e-commerce application; a webserver running ubuntu with apache, PHP, Wordpress/ WooCommerce and a database server running Ubuntu with MySQL version 5.7.

- Identify the components that need to be migrated.
- Create a detailed migration plan, including timelines and resource requirements.

### 2. Target Environment

The following target Amazon Virtual private cloud (VPC) is deployed during the environment preparation.


### 2. AWS Account Setup

- Set up an AWS account if you don't already have one. 
- Configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions.
- Set up billing and cost monitoring to track expenses.

### 3. Networking

- Design your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture.
- Configure network settings, subnets, and security groups.
- Establish VPN or Direct Connect if needed for on-premises connectivity.

### 4. Data Migration

- Choose an appropriate data migration strategy (e.g., AWS Database Migration Service, AWS Snowball, etc.).
- Migrate your application data and databases to AWS.
- Verify data integrity and consistency.

### 5. Application Deployment

- Set up EC2 instances or choose a serverless approach (e.g., AWS Lambda).
- Install and configure your application and its dependencies.
- Ensure proper scaling and load balancing for high availability.

### 6. Testing and Validation

- Conduct thorough testing of your migrated application.
- Perform load testing to ensure scalability.
- Monitor application performance and optimize as needed.

## Monitoring and Optimization

- Implement AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.
- Continuously optimize your AWS resources for cost efficiency.
- Implement auto-scaling and redundancy for improved reliability.

## Security Considerations

- Follow AWS best practices for security (e.g., IAM, Security Groups, Network ACLs).
- Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access and permissions.
- Enable encryption for data in transit and at rest.

## Troubleshooting

- Monitor AWS CloudWatch logs for error tracking.
- Utilize AWS support resources and forums for assistance.
- Maintain backup and recovery strategies.
